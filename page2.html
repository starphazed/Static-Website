                Yin and Yang originate from ancient Chinese philosophy and are a foundational concept in Taoism. They 
                represent the dual forces of nature that exist in balance within the universe. The symbolism of Yin and 
                Yang aligns closely with the number 2, as both emphasize the idea of opposites working in harmony to form 
                a whole. Yin, associated with darkness, femininity, and passivity, is balanced by Yang, representing 
                light, masculinity, and activity. In Chinese culture, this duality illustrates how seemingly opposing forces 
                are interconnected and interdependent, much like the number 2 symbolizes the relationship between 
                complementary elements.
