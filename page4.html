                The number 4 is significant in many cultures and religions, often symbolizing stability and order. In 
                Christianity, it is closely associated with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, figures from the Book of 
                Revelation in the New Testament. These horsemen—Conquest, War, Famine, and Death—each represent different 
                forms of devastation that will occur during the apocalypse, riding on white, red, black, and pale horses, 
                respectively.

                The Four Horsemen are central to Christian eschatology, representing divine judgment and the trials humanity 
                will face before the end of the world. Their imagery reflects themes of destruction and chaos, with the 
                number 4 symbolizing the completeness of their impact on the world as they bring suffering and death, 
                marking the final stages of human history according to Christian beliefs.
