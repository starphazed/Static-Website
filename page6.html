                The number 6 holds significant meaning in Buddhism, symbolizing the Six Realms of Existence. These realms, 
                also known as the Six Paths, represent the different states of existence that sentient beings are reborn 
                into, based on their karma. The realms include Heavenly Beings (Devas), Humans, Asuras (demigods), Animals, 
                Hungry Ghosts (Preta), and Hell Beings. Each realm reflects a particular type of suffering or pleasure, 
                with beings moving through these realms depending on their actions and intentions in previous lives.

                While the Heavenly Realm is a place of great pleasure and long life, even it is impermanent, as beings there 
                eventually fall back into the cycle of rebirth. The Human Realm is considered the most favorable because it 
                offers a balance of pleasure and suffering, making it ideal for spiritual growth and the pursuit of 
                enlightenment. The lower realms, such as the Animal, Hungry Ghost, and Hell Realms, represent states of 
                ignorance, insatiable desire, and intense suffering. In Buddhist teachings, the goal is to transcend these 
                realms by breaking free from samsara, the cycle of rebirth, through the attainment of Nirvana.
